===============================================================

This program creates a GUI that has a grid of images that represent the communication device of the Augmentive and Alternative Communication Device (AAC). In this mini-project, we explored associative arrays and learned more about some of the issues at play in designing 
software for people with disabilities (and using software as a disabled person).
